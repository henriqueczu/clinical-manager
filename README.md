# Clinical Manager

This repository contains a simple **Clinical Manager** system built in **pure Java**, without any frameworks.

## 📚 About the Project

The main goal of this project is to serve as a learning exercise while I improve my skills in Java. For that reason, the project is developed without using frameworks like Spring Boot — at least for now. Once I reach a more advanced level, I plan to refactor or expand this project using Spring Boot or other modern tools.

## 🩺 Features

This is a basic command-line system that allows you to:

- Register doctors 🩻
- Register patients 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
- Schedule appointments 📅
- View the list of doctors, patients, and scheduled appointments

⚠️ To create an appointment, at least one doctor and one patient must be registered.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

As I keep learning, I plan to add:

- Data persistence (file or database storage)
- Better input validation
- Cancel/edit appointments
- A simple GUI or web interface
- Integration with frameworks (Spring Boot, Hibernate...)

## 👨‍💻 Technologies Used

- Java (pure)
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Java Collections
- Java Time API

## 🧠 Motivation

This project is part of my journey to master Java. It started as a small exercise and will grow as I explore more concepts and tools.
Feel free to suggest improvements!
